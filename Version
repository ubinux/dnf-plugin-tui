Version: 1.3

Version upgrade rules:
At the timing of the monthly ubinux release, if there's upgrade since the ubinux release in the previous release, so upgrade the version. 
For example:
Ubinux-2023.11 uses the version of 1.3, and if ubinux-2023.12 updateds the source of dnf-plugin-tui, so upgrade version of dnf-plugin-tui to 1.4.
Ubinux-2023.11 uses the version of 1.3, and if ubinux-2023.12 does not update dnf-plugin-tui, so version of dnf-plugin-tui remains 1.3..
Naming rules are the same as 1.3, 1.4, 1.5...
